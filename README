A set of binary, hex, ascii binary and nist format converters. 

$ hex2bin -h
Usage: hex2bin [-h][-s lines_to_skip][-o <out filename>][filename]
       -s n          Skip the first n lines of the input text
       -o filename   Output to file filename instead of stdout

$ bin2hex -h
Usage: bin2hex [-w <width>][-h][-o <out filename>] [filename]

Convert binary data to hexadecimal.

$  bin201 -h
Usage: bin201 [-w <width>][-b][-h][-o <out filename>] [filename]
  -w <width> Sets the number of bits per output line
  -B         Reverses the order of bits in each byte to big endian
  -L         Outputs bits as little endian (default)
Convert binary data to ascii binary (01001001).

$ bin2nistoddball -h
Usage: bin2nistoddball [-l <bits_per_symbol 1-8>][-B|-L][-v][-h][-o <out filename>] [filename]
       -l , --length <bits_per_symbol 1-8> Set the number of bits to encode in eat output byte
       -r , --reverse                      Interpret input binary data as big endian (MSB first) (default is little endian)
       -B , --bigendian                    Unpack output multi-bit symbols as big-endian (msb first)
       -L , --littleendian                 Unpack output multi-bit symbols as little-endian (lsb first) (default)
       -v , --verbose                      Output information to stderr
       -h , --help                         Output this information

Convert binary data to NIST Oddball SP800-90B one-symbol-per-byte format.

$ nistoddball2bin -h
Usage: nistoddball2bin [-l <bits_per_symbol 1-8>][-B|-L][-v][-h][-o <out filename>] [filename]
       -l n          Set the number of symbol bits per byte encoded in the input data. Must be between 1 to 8
       -B            Interpret the input symbols at being big endian (MSB first)
       -L            Interpret the input symbols at being little endian (LSB first) (default)
       -v            Verbose mode. Outputs information to stderr
       -h            Display this information
       -o filename   Output to file filename instead of stdout

Convert binary data to NIST Oddball SP800-90B one-symbol-per-byte format.

Notes:
      The NIST format for SP800-90B testing requires symbols to be as one symbol per byte.
      This means only symbols of sizes 1 through 8 bits can be supported.
      The bit ordering of the bits within the symbols is not specified by NIST. The -L and -B options allow you to choose.
      The output binary data by default is in little endian format, with the lower order bits in bytes coming before higher order bits. This can be reversed with the -r option.
      
Two programs to convert between hex and binary format. bin2hex exists
because it has a more compact output format than od or hexdump.  hex2bin
exists just for the sake of symmetry.

bin2nistoddball converts binary to the oddball one-symbol-per-byte 
format used by the NIST SP800-90B sofware. nistoddball2bin does the
reverse.

bin201 converts binary to ASCII binary
